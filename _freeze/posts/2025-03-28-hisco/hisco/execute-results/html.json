I always need to look up HISCO groups, and I have scraped and stored this information in [this github repo](https://github.com/j-jayes/HISCO) but it would be nice to have it in a table to qukickly look up.\n\n\n## Overview of HISCO\n\nThe Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations (HISCO) is a standardized system developed to classify and compare historical occupations across different countries and time periods. It is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) from 1968 and has been adapted for historical research purposes. HISCO provides a common framework that enables researchers to analyze social structures, economic development, and labor market changes over time.\n\n## Structure of HISCO\n\nHISCO employs a hierarchical coding system consisting of five digits:\n\n- **Major Groups:** The first digit represents broad occupational categories.\n- **Minor Groups:** The second digit specifies subgroups within the major group.\n- **Unit Groups:** The third digit further refines the occupation category.\n- **Headings:** The fourth and fifth digits provide detailed occupational titles.\n\nThis structure allows for detailed classification and analysis of occupations.\n\n\n### HISCO Major Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"onmscbnknc\"

This tool aids researchers in analyzing historical occupational data. \n\n- **Machine Learning Based Classifier** [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/christianvedels/OccCANINE) hosts \"a tool designed to transform occupational descriptions into standardized HISCO (Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations) codes automatically. Developed by Christian Møller Dahl, Torben Johansen and Christian Vedel from the University of Southern Denmark, this tool leverages the power of a finetuned language model to process and classify occupational descriptions with high accuracy, precision, and recall.\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis post provides a structured overview of HISCO, its major groups, related classification systems, and available resources.
