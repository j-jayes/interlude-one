In [this episode](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/21/989625586/the-100-million-deli) of the podcast [Planet Money](https://twitter.com/planetmoney), Mary Childs and Jacob Goldstein explain that one possible reason for the high market cap may be that the deli will be the subject of a reverse takeover (RTO) in the future.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-82982e40dabb207ceb1a\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"leaflet html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-82982e40dabb207ceb1a\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a> contributors, <a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\\\">CC-BY-SA<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[39.8401,-75.239275,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},\"<b><a href='https://sec.report/CIK/0001632081'>Hometown Deli<\\/a><\\/b><br/>541 A MANTUA AVE<br/>PAULSBORO, NJ\",null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[39.8401,39.8401],\"lng\":[-75.239275,-75.239275]},\"fitBounds\":[39.844,-75.238,39.835,-75.239,[]]},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMap locating Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, NJ, the only asset of [Hometown International, Inc](https://sec.report/CIK/0001632081)\n\n\nIn a reverse takeover, a private company wants to go public. Instead of going through the hoops of having an Initial Public Offering (IPO), the private company simply buys some semi-defunct but still publicly traded company in order to become publicly traded (usually in the US) themselves. This skirts the onerous requirements that come with making an IPO.\n\nWe know what we do about this deli, including that it was founded by a high-school wrestling coach, because of rules governing the transparency of public companies in the US. Publicly traded companies must make regular submissions to the SEC informing regulators and potential investors of their operations.\n\nI was inspired by this story to investigate the kinds of submissions that firms make to the SEC when there is a change in leadership. The 8-K form is an unscheduled submission detailing events or corporate changes at a company including acquisitions, bankruptcy, the resignation of directors, or changes in the fiscal year.\n\nIn this post I examine a dataset of ceo exits between x and x in the USA. I create a text classifier using the 8-K submissions of firms. I examine the components of the classification model and I show that it is difficult to predict if a CEO has been fired or retires based on the words of the 8-K submissions alone.\n\n# CEO exits\n\nThe dataset I analyse comes from [Gentry et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3278) accessible [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4618103#.YJLt6pAzaUk). It details more than 1,400 CEO dismissals at S&P 1500 companies between 1992 and 2018, as well as noting many other reasons for CEO turnover.\n\nAs we can see by mousing over the figure below, since 1995 CEOs have, by and large, retired (shown in green) or are left involuntarily after being dismissed for poor job performance (shown in blue). The orange category, other, is not very informative. We will limit our classification problem to just the first two classes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::::: {.panelset}\n\n::: {.panel}\n\n## CEO exits over time {.panel-name}\n\nWe can see that retirements make up nearly 50 percent of the observations throughout our sample.\n\n<centre>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-f845ac3e14b82cbef724\"
