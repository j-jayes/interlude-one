He has been described [in the New York Times as](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/arts/music/anthony-fantano-the-needle-drop.html):\n\n<blockquote>\n\nThe Only Music Critic Who Matters (if Youâ€™re Under 25)\n\n</blockquote>\n\nI love to watch his videos and share his penchant for albums that are cohesive, and tell a story. I eagerly awaited [his review of the new Kendrick Lamar ablum, *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHQE7tULx6c) (which he gave a **light eight out of ten**).\n\nThis got me wondering if I could measure how he describes an album that he enjoys, or particularly dislikes. I remember Chance the Rapper's album The Big Day being describes as [\"a pile of slop\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjriHA-MLPg) and being given a rather vicious **zero out of ten**.\n\nThis question can be framed as a regression problem -- the score Fantano rates an album is the outcome variable, and the words that he uses in the review are predictors.\n\n## Don't bury the lede\n\nHere are the words I found that Fantano uses \n\n\n## Next steps\n\nI really want to create an interactive widget that lets you describe and album and provide some attributes and then predicts the score that Fantano would give.\n\nIt would be really fun to use Shapley values as a way to highlight what variables are important in the prediction. I could perhaps use a huggingface transformer model instead of my simple logistic regression model?\n\n## Process (if you're interested)\n\nThe remainder of this post discusses how I collected the data and \n",
