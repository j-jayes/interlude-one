These ranges provide a comprehensive overview to refine your financial model for a solar energy system in South Africa.

The significant variation in prices for solar components and installation services in South Africa arises from several factors, including product specifications, quality, brand reputation, and market dynamics. To provide a more precise range for your financial model, I've researched specific products from Revov.co.za and gathered information on labor costs for installation.

**1. LiFePO₄ Batteries (per kWh)**

Revov offers a range of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO₄) batteries with varying capacities and prices:

- **REVOV 12V 100Ah (1.28 kWh):** R6,679
  - Price per kWh: R5,218
- **REVOV 12V 200Ah (2.56 kWh):** R10,889
  - Price per kWh: R4,254
- **REVOV R100 (5.12 kWh):** R19,601
  - Price per kWh: R3,829
- **REVOV B100 (5.12 kWh):** R25,554
  - Price per kWh: R4,992
- **REVOV R200 (10.2 kWh):** R42,057
  - Price per kWh: R4,122
- **REVOV L-51220C (11.26 kWh):** R45,735
  - Price per kWh: R4,063

These prices indicate that larger capacity batteries tend to have a lower cost per kWh, ranging from approximately R3,829 to R5,218 per kWh.

**2. Labor Costs for Installation**

Labor costs for installing solar systems in South Africa can vary based on system size, complexity, and installer expertise. Specific labor cost insights include:

- **Per Panel Installation:** Approximately R1,000 per panel. For example, installing five 350W panels could cost around R5,000, with a recommended budget of R8,000 to accommodate additional expenses. citeturn0search3
- **Inverter Installation:** Connecting an inverter to the existing distribution board (DB), including necessary cabling and a Certificate of Compliance (CoC), may cost around R3,500. It's advisable to budget up to R10,000 to account for potential issues during testing. citeturn0search3
- **General Installation Costs:** Labor charges typically range from R15,000 to R25,000 for standard installations, depending on the system's complexity and the installer's rates. citeturn0search1
- **System Size Considerations:** For larger systems, such as an 8 kW setup with 10 kWh battery storage, installation costs can vary. One example includes:

  - **System Components:**
    - 10 × 545W JA Solar panels
    - 8 kW Sunsynk inverter
    - 2 × 5.32 kWh Sunsynk batteries
  - **Total Cost:** R190,000 (including installation)
  - This suggests that for such a system, the installation labor component could be estimated between R17,000 and R20,000. citeturn0search7

**Summary of Findings**

- **LiFePO₄ Batteries:** Based on Revov's offerings, prices range from approximately R3,829 to R5,218 per kWh, with larger capacity batteries generally offering a lower cost per kWh.
- **Installation Labor Costs:** Labor charges for installing solar systems in South Africa typically range from R15,000 to R25,000, depending on system size and complexity.

These refined figures should assist in developing a more accurate financial model for your solar energy system project.
