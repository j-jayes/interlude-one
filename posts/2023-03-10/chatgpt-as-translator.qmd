## Introduction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
Data is the lifeblood of modern economic history. It courses through our models and charts the path of history. Yet data is often born unruly, its words jumbled and disorganized, its meaning buried under mountains of text. For the economic historian, this is an all too familiar challenge. We need to extract structure from chaos, to transform raw text into organized data that we can analyze.

But doing so by hand is a laborious and time-consuming task, one that demands hours of tedious work and a heightened attention to detail. Luckily, we live in an age of powerful AI tools, such as ChatGPT, that can help us wrangle our data and make sense of the world.

## A typical problem

I am interested in a source of Swedish biographical data called [Vem är Vem?](http://runeberg.org/vemarvem/sthlm45/0018.html) (or Who is Who?), part of Projekt Runeberg, a volunteer effort to create free electronic editions of classic Nordic (Scandinavian) literature.

Careful work by two librarians in Uppsala has resulted in a large selection of the source being scanned and digitized. Though the OCR engine is not perfect, the resulting text is largely legible.

[The city librarian in Uppsala Paul Harnesk was the initiator and chief editor of the work Who is Who? which was published in two editions, each comprising five parts. He died in 1965 and the work was completed by the first librarian at Uppsala University Library, associate professor Åke Davidsson.]{.aside}

## ChtGPT as translator

Can you convert the following text from Swedish into English? There are many abbreviations, for instance, "f." means "född" or born, "Med. kand." means "medicine kandidat"

It is a biography about a man:

<blockquote>

Abramson, Ernst Leopold, professor, Djursholm, born in Grava, Värmland, on March 12, 1896, to estate owner Hugo A. and Anna Salén. He obtained a medicine kandidat degree in Stockholm in 1918, followed by a medical licentiate and doctorate in 1927. He was a docent in physiology in 1927 and worked as a laboratory assistant in physiology from 1930 to 1938. From 1938, he was a professor and director at the State Institute for Public Health. He served as a battalion doctor and reserve officer from 1927 and was a teacher in physiology and movement physiology at the Gymnastics Central Institute from 1922 to 1930. He was a member of the Army Medical Corps and Reserve Force from 1924 to 1936, a member of the Scientific Council of the Army Medical Service from 1936, and a member of the School Management Association of Doctors from 1928. He was also a member of the Directorate of the Gymnastics Central Institute from 1933, its chairman from 1936, and a member and secretary of the Nutrition Council from 1936. In addition, he was the chairman of the 1936 Food Legislation Committee. He authored around 50 works, primarily related to nutrition physiology, physiology, mechanics, and muscle physiology. He was awarded the Royal Order of the North Star (RNO).

Great, thank you, can you extract the occupations he held and the dates for which he held them, and return the output in an R tibble with a column for start year, a column for end year (if any), a column for the Swedish description of the occupation, and a column for the English translation.
