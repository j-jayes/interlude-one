title: "Predicting South Africa's youth employment"

Predctive Insights is running a competition on Zindi to predict which young people will find employment. The competition uses data from Statistics South Africa's quartlery labour force survey. The data is available on the [Zindi website](https://zindi.africa/competitions/predictive-insights-youth-income-prediction-challenge).

While the prediction problem is interesting, perhaps more interesting is the quirk of the data that I discovered while exploring it. 

## My approach to the problem

My approach to predictions problems is very formulaic. 

1. draw a bunch of graphs
2. run a lasso regression to get an idea of which variables are important
3. run an ensemble of models including a random forest, a gradient boosting machine, and a neural network
4. profit.
