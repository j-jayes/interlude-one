## Available data

## Academic data processing

I have been happy to help a number of my colleagues with scraping data from public websites or processing geographic data. I link these GitHub repositories here, in case you're looking for inspiration on how to structure a scraping project, or perhaps want to access data on soil suitability or Europe's urban populations.

### Scraping a genealogy wiki of Sweden's noble families

[Here](https://github.com/j-jayes/adelsvapen) I scraped and structured a database of more than 120,000 individuals belonging to various branches of Sweden's nobility.

```{r}
#| column: page
#| out-width: "100%"
#| #| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_url(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/adelsvapen/main/images/example_data.PNG", height = 800)
```


### Scraping tax registers from the Stockholm City Archive

[Here](https://github.com/j-jayes/mantalsregister-1909) I scraped an index of records from 1800 to 1880 for residents of Sweden's most populous city, Stockholm. 

```{r}
#| column: page
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/mantalsregister-1909/main/README_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png")
```

### Soil suitability calculation

[In this project](https://github.com/j-jayes/soil-suitability#purpose), I helped acquire data on soil suitability for wheat cultivation across Europe, and aggregate the raster spatial data to NUTS 2 and NUT 3 regions for use as control variables in a study of persistence.

```{r}
#| column: page
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/soil-suitability/main/images/fao_interface.PNG")
```

### European population aggregations

[In this project](https://github.com/j-jayes/european-population-aggregations#download-the-data), I helped aggregate the population from cities across Europe to NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions, to show the growth of urban populations across time.

```{r}
#| column: page
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/european-population-aggregations/main/images/map-pop-1950.png")
```
