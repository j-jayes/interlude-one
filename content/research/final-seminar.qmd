I presented the final seminar on my dissertation at the Lund University Economic History Department seminar on May 7, 2025.

I was grateful for comments and feedback from Josef Taalbi and Kristin Ranestad.

On this page I include my slides, the Kappa (or introductory chapter) of my dissertation, and the drafts of the four papers that make up the dissertation.

Here are the slides from my presentation:
