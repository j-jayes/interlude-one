## Motivation

1. Electrification is a cannonical example of a **General Purpose Technology (GPT)**

2. When this new technology was adopted in Sweden:

    - It made individuals richer 💰🔋
    - It lowered inequality 📉🤝
    - It allowed structural change on the labor market 🔧💼


2. What we want to know next:

    - Who were the innovators or adopters? 🤔🚀
    - Did they move to opportunity? 🏃‍♀️💼
    - How much training did they have in the new technology? 🎓⚡️
    

## Who is who?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

Vem är Vem? is a **Swedish biographical encyclopedia** that was published in two editions of five volumes each in 1945–1950 and 1962–1968 by Bokförlaget Vem är Vem.

The intention was, according to the publishers, to draw attention **to people who were at the height of their activities**, even if they were younger, in influential or otherwise noted positions in different areas.

- Biographies and career trajectories of ~ 69,448 individuals!

- 8 of the 10 volumes are digitized by librarians in Uppsala – thank you <3

## 1. Translate 🤖

### Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 chat API:

We tell the system "You are an expert in Swedish family history"

Then we ask it to translate the Swedish text to English

<br>

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

def translate_and_structure_text(swedish_text):
    try:
        # Translate the Swedish text to English
        translate_prompt = f"Translate the following abbreviated Swedish biography to English: {swedish_text}"
        translation_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on Swedish family history."},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"{translate_prompt}"}
            ]
        )

```


## 2. Structure 🤖

![](assets/schema.png)

## 2. Structure 🤖

### Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 chat API:

We tell the system "You are an expert in Swedish family history and the Schema.org/Person format" 

We provide it the original Swedish and English translation, and ask it to structure the biography in Schema.org/Person format as a JSON object

<br>


```{python, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

structure_prompt = f"Given the original Swedish biography: {swedish_text}\nAnd its English translation: {english_text}, Structure the biography in Schema.org/Person format as a JSON object. Include dates wherever possible. Only provide a  RFC8259 compliant JSON response."

structure_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on Swedish family history and the Schema.org/Person format."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"{structure_prompt}"}
    ]
)
```

## 3. Augment 🤖

### Using OpenAI's GPT-4 chat API:

We create python code to geocode any addresses in the biography (in this example), as well as flagging the highest level of education, and extract any mention of patents or inventions in the biography.

<br>


```{python, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

def geocode_birthplace(birthplace, geolocator, geocoded_cache):
    if isinstance(birthplace, dict):
        if "name" in birthplace:
            birthplace_name = birthplace["name"]
        elif "address" in birthplace and "addressLocality" in birthplace["address"]:
            birthplace_name = birthplace["address"]["addressLocality"]
        else:
            print(f"Invalid birthplace data: {birthplace}")
            return None
    elif isinstance(birthplace, str):
        birthplace_name = birthplace
    else:
        print(f"Invalid birthplace data: {birthplace}")
        return None

    if birthplace_name not in geocoded_cache:
        try:
            location = geolocator.geocode(birthplace_name)
            if location:
                geocoded_cache[birthplace_name] = {
                    "latitude": location.latitude,
                    "longitude": location.longitude
                }
            time.sleep(1)  # Add a 1-second delay between geocoding requests
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error geocoding birthplace {birthplace_name}: {e}")

    return geocoded_cache.get(birthplace_name)
```
