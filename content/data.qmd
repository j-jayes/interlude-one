## Available data

I have done a fair bit of web scraping to get data into usable formats.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

tribble(
  ~title, ~description, ~link,
  # car scraper
  "Car Scraper ZA", "An automated scraper that gets adverts for vehicles off of [Gumtree in South Africa](https://www.gumtree.co.za/) every day and stores them on this GitHub repo. Have a look at [my Shiny App](https://jonathan-jayes.shinyapps.io/gumtree-price-explorer/) to understand the kind of data collected.", "https://github.com/j-jayes/car-scraper-za",
  # bike scraper
  "Bicycle Advert Scraper", "Similar to the car scraper, this repo autmotically scrapes adverts for bicycles from [Bikehub](https://bikehub.co.za/) and [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.co.za/).", "https://github.com/j-jayes/bicycle_advert_scraper",
  # job tech dev
  "Swedish Job adverts",  "This repo contains a one percent sample of the enriched jobtech data from [jobtechdev.se](jobtechdev.se). They provide a one percent sample of all jobs advertised in Sweden from 2016 to 2022Q2 to help you get to grips with the data. I simply put it into excel format from `json`", "https://github.com/j-jayes/job-tech-dev-se",
  # animal husbandry
  "Swedish Agriculture and Livestock", "This repo is for the digitization of the SCB reports on Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. They span from 1865 to 1911. You can have a look at [my Shiny app](https://jonathan-jayes.shinyapps.io/Agriculture-and-Livestock-Management-Data-Explorer/) to get a better understanding",
  "https://github.com/j-jayes/animal-husbandry",
  # swedish patents
  "Swedish patent data", "I have scraped Google Patents for 10,000 patents that were registered in Sweden, and collected PDF data from The Swedish Patent Registration Authority for further analysis.", "https://github.com/j-jayes/swedish-patent-data",
  # LinkedIn WorldBank data
  "Hot Jobs in Sweden from LinkedIn", "This repo has a set of data from LinkedIn's collaboration with the World Bank on talent migration. I've written a short report on the data [here](https://j-jayes.github.io/WB-LinkedIn-Migration/)", "https://github.com/j-jayes/WB-LinkedIn-Migration"
) %>% 
  mutate(
    title = glue::glue("<a href = {link}>
                             {title}
                                   </a>"),
    title = purrr::map(title, gt::html)
  ) %>%
  # group_by(title) %>%
  select(-link) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "#191970"),
      cell_text(color = "white")
    ),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c("description"))
  ) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Available Data**"),
    subtitle = md("[From my GitHub repos](https://github.com/j-jayes)")
  ) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = description) %>% 
  cols_align(columns = title, align = "left") %>%
  cols_label(
    title = "Title and link",
    description = "Description"
  )
```


## Academic data processing

I have been happy to help a number of my colleagues with scraping data from public websites or processing geographic data. I link these GitHub repositories here, in case you're looking for inspiration on how to structure a scraping project, or perhaps want to access data on soil suitability or Europe's urban populations.

### Scraping a genealogy wiki of Sweden's noble families

[Here](https://github.com/j-jayes/adelsvapen) I scraped and structured a database of more than 120,000 individuals belonging to various branches of Sweden's nobility.

```{r}
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/adelsvapen/main/images/example_data.PNG")
```


### Scraping tax registers from the Stockholm City Archive

[Here](https://github.com/j-jayes/mantalsregister-1909) I scraped an index of records from 1800 to 1880 for residents of Sweden's most populous city, Stockholm. 

```{r}
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/mantalsregister-1909/main/README_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png")
```

### Soil suitability calculation

[In this project](https://github.com/j-jayes/soil-suitability#purpose), I helped acquire data on soil suitability for wheat cultivation across Europe, and aggregate the raster spatial data to NUTS 2 and NUT 3 regions for use as control variables in a study of persistence.

```{r}
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/soil-suitability/main/images/fao_interface.PNG")
```

### European population aggregations

[In this project](https://github.com/j-jayes/european-population-aggregations#download-the-data), I helped aggregate the population from cities across Europe to NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions, to show the growth of urban populations across time.

```{r}
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-height: 8

knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/european-population-aggregations/main/images/map-pop-1950.png")
```
