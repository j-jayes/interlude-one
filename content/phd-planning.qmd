I need to commit to more structure and deadlines in order to complete my PhD on time.

My PhD consists of four papers and coursework.

## Papers

1. [Shocked by Electricity](https://j-jayes.github.io/shocked-by-electricity/#/title-slide): The impact of new technology on individuals and local labour markets. Co authored with Kerstin Enflo and Jakob Molinder

2. [Wired for Success](https://interludeone.com/content/research/wired-for-success-abstract): Swedenâ€™s Electrical Innovators in the Age of Industrial Transformation

Here is a chart showing the remaining time in my PhD and what is left to do.

2. EHEH002 Foundations of Economic History: **1/3 papers done** . Assuming linear progression and that each paper is worth an equal amount of credits, I've completed 1/3 of 15 credits = 5 credits.

**Total for Mandatory** : 7.5 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 7.5 + 4.5 = **24.5 credits** 

**Optional courses (22.5 credit points):**  
1. EEH005F Economic Growth over Time and Space: **Completed**  - 7.5 credits.

**Total for Optional** : **7.5 credits**
