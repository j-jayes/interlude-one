<h1>A $100m Deli?</h1>
<p>Last month we learned about a mostly unremarkable deli in New Jersey, USA, with an unlikely market capitalisation of $100 million. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/21/989625586/the-100-million-deli">this episode</a> of the podcast <a href="https://twitter.com/planetmoney">Planet Money</a>, Mary Childs and Jacob Goldstein explain that one possible reason for the high market cap may be that the deli will be the subject of a reverse takeover (RTO) in the future.</p>

<p>Map locating Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, NJ, the only asset of <a href="https://sec.report/CIK/0001632081">Hometown International, Inc</a></p>
<p>In a reverse takeover, a private company wants to go public. Instead of going through the hoops of having an Initial Public Offering (IPO), the private company simply buys some semi-defunct but still publicly traded company in order to become publicly traded (usually in the US) themselves. This skirts the onerous requirements that come with making an IPO.</p>
<p>We know what we do about this deli, including that it was founded by a high-school wrestling coach, because of rules governing the transparency of public companies in the US. Publicly traded companies must make regular submissions to the SEC informing regulators and potential investors of their operations.</p>
<p>I was inspired by this story to investigate the kinds of submissions that firms make to the SEC when there is a change in leadership. The 8-K form is an unscheduled submission detailing events or corporate changes at a company including acquisitions, bankruptcy, the resignation of directors, or changes in the fiscal year.</p>
<p>In this post I examine a dataset of ceo exits between x and x in the USA. I create a text classifier using the 8-K submissions of firms. I examine the components of the classification model and I show that it is difficult to predict if a CEO has been fired or retires based on the words of the 8-K submissions alone.</p>

<h1>CEO exits</h1>
<p>The dataset I analyse comes from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3278">Gentry et al.</a> accessible <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4618103#.YJLt6pAzaUk">here</a>. It details more than 1,400 CEO dismissals at S&amp;P 1500 companies between 1992 and 2018, as well as noting many other reasons for CEO turnover.</p>
<p>As we can see by mousing over the figure below, since 1995 CEOs have, by and large, retired (shown in green) or are left involuntarily after being dismissed for poor job performance (shown in blue). The orange category, other, is not very informative. We will limit our classification problem to just the first two classes.</p>

This included situations where the CEO was immediately terminated as well as when the CEO was given some transition period, but the media coverage was negative. Often the media cited financial performance or some other failing of CEO job performance (e.g., leadership deficiencies, innovation weaknesses, etc.).","The CEO was terminated for behavioral or policy-related problems. The CEO's departure was almost always immediate, and the announcement cited an instance where the CEO violated company HR policy, expense account cheating, etc.","Voluntary retirement based on how the turnover was reported in the media. Here the departure did not sound forced, and the CEO often had a voice or comment in the succession announcement. Media coverage of voluntary turnover was more valedictory than critical. Firms use different mandatory retirement ages, so we could not use 65 or older and facing mandatory retirement as a cut off. We examined coverage around the event and subsequent coverage of the CEO’s career when it sounded unclear.","The CEO left to pursue a new venture or to work at another company. This frequently occurred in startup firms and for founders.","Interim CEOs, CEO departure following a merger or acquisition, company ceased to exist, company changed key identifiers so it is not an actual turnover, and CEO may or may not have taken over the new company.","Despite attempts to collect information, there was not sufficient data to assign a code to the turnover event. These will remain the subject of further investigation and expansion.","If a researcher were to create a dataset of all potential turnovers using execucomp (co_per_rol != l.co_per_rol), several instances will appear of what looks like a turnover when there was no actual event.

<h1>8-K Forms and text data</h1>
<p>To determine if a CEO retired or was fired, I will make use of the 8-K forms filed 270 days before and after the date of exit. The 8-K fillings. I include a screenshot below of an 8-K filling from <a href="https://sec.report/CIK/0001632081">Hometown International Inc.</a>.</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Hometown’s current 8-K</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I scraped these 8-K fillings from the SEC website and removed the formulaic text at the begninning of each form detailing the location of company headquarters and such.</p>
<p>If you want to see the scraping code, have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/j-jayes/tidy-tuesday/blob/main/code/ceo-exits.Rmd">GitHub here</a></p>
<p>I then tokenized the text into words using the tokenizer from the <code>tidytext</code> package from <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">Julia Silge and David Robinson</a>.</p>
